## The Game
You are a cat named Dumpling who is always hungry, but dogs are hoarding all the dumplings from you. Your goal is to collect as many dumplings as possible without colliding with any of the dogs. Once you lose all 3 lives, its gameover! The dogs can come from left or right at varying speeds and you can dodge them by moving up, down, left, right. For dogs who are above you, you can also launch some projectiles to make the dog disappear.

## How to Play
Your player, Dumpling, will start at the bottom of the screen. Dogs enter from both sides, running across the screen.
- use the arrow keys to move Dumpling up, down, left or right
- press the space bar to launch projectiles at the dogs
